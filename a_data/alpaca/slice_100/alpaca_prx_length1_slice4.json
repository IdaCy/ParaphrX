The key thing, the absolute necessity, is that the data you are searching through must be in order, it must be sorted. If it's not sorted, binary search simply will not function correctly or at all. The way it operates, its modus operandi, is that it repeatedly, over and over, divides the area you are searching in, the search space, into two halves.
