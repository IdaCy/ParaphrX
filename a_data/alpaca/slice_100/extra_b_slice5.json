    "instruct_role_expert_cot_with_examples": "As an acclaimed food writer, my craft is to paint vivid pictures with words. When presented with a bland statement like \"The food was delicious.,\" my mind immediately seeks to unpack the 'deliciousness.' For example, was it 'the buttery flakiness of the croissant,' or 'the fiery kick of the chili oil,' or 'the earthy sweetness of roasted root vegetables'?

Here, 'warm,' 'artisanal,' 'crusty,' 'soft,' 'airy,' and 'yeasty sweetness' provide tangible sensory information, explaining *how* it was delicious. \n\nNow, embodying this expert mindset, rewrite \"The food was delicious.\" into a truly descriptive sentence, providing an explanation of the sensory details you incorporated and why they are effective.",

These specific details explain the 'deliciousness' by engaging the reader's senses. The goal is a concise, impactful summary of the experience.\n\nNow, channel this expertise: rewrite \"The food was delicious.\" into a highly descriptive sentence.

The risk of plain language is that it fails to convey the true enjoyment.\n\nNow, embodying this expert approach, rewrite \"The food was delicious.\" into a detailed, sensory-rich sentence.

The texture (crispy, chewy, creamy, tender, crunchy, smooth, flaky)? The aroma (fragrant, pungent, earthy, sweet)? The appearance (vibrant colors, glistening, artfully arranged)? The sound (sizzling, crunchy bite)?\n2.  **Brainstorm specific vocabulary:** For each identified sensory component, list at least three specific adjectives or verbs that evoke that sensation more precisely than \"delicious.\"\n3.  **Combine elements:** Construct a single, flowing sentence that integrates these specific sensory details. Aim to create a mental picture or sensation for the reader.\n4.  **Avoid generic synonyms:** Do not simply replace \"delicious\" with \"scrumptious\" or \"tasty.\" Dig deeper for true descriptiveness.\n\nYour final output should be a single, compelling sentence that makes \"The food was delicious.\" obsolete.",

    "instruct_with_rebuttals": "While some might argue that \"The food was delicious.\" is perfectly clear and concise, this simplicity often sacrifices the sensory richness and emotional impact that a truly engaging description provides. Such a generic statement offers no insight into *what* made it delicious, leaving the reader disengaged. To rebut this notion effectively, rewrite the sentence \"The food was delicious.\" into a form that is strikingly more descriptive, proving that vivid language enhances, rather than detracts from, effective communication.",
    "instruct_with_similes": "The sentence \"The food was delicious.\" is as plain as unsalted crackers. Your goal is to transform it into something vibrant, like a perfectly seasoned, multi-layered dish. Rewrite \"The food was delicious.\" into a more descriptive form, using vivid language that appeals to the senses, much like a gourmet meal tantalizes the palate.",
    "instruct_with_statistics": "Studies show that descriptions leveraging sensory details are 70% more engaging than generic statements. For example, a restaurant review saying \"The aromatic truffle pasta, with its perfectly al dente noodles and rich, creamy sauce, transported me to Italy\" receives significantly more positive reader feedback than simply \"The pasta was delicious.\" Leveraging these insights, rewrite the sentence \"The food was delicious.\" into a more descriptive form that appeals to multiple senses, aiming for maximum reader engagement.",

    "instruct_with_technical_details": "To accurately convey the gustatory experience, a simple qualitative assessment like \"The food was delicious.\" is insufficient. Employ precise chemosensory descriptors (e.g., umami, sweet, savory, piquant), haptic attributes (e.g., succulence, crispness, viscosity), and olfactory components (e.g., aromatic, pungent, floral) to reconstruct the sensory profile.

I then design the water supply, often favoring a PEX manifold system (example), which provides individual runs to fixtures, explaining how this offers superior pressure balance and easier shut-off for maintenance compared to trunk-and-branch systems. Lastly, I meticulously plan the DWV system, ensuring proper sizing (e.g., minimum 1.5-inch drain for a single lavatory, explanation: this prevents slow drainage and clogs based on fixture unit ratings) and adequate venting for all traps. In summary, I focus on efficiency, code compliance, and ease of maintenance throughout the entire design process for a two-story residential plumbing system.",
    "instruct_role_expert_cot_with_examples_and_explanations_and_summary_and_risks": "As a leading plumbing design specialist, my process for constructing comprehensive plumbing diagrams for a two-story house is thorough and risk-aware. I begin by evaluating the building's structural and architectural plans to determine optimal fixture placement; for example, stacking bathrooms on different floors directly above each other simplifies drain-waste-vent (DWV) risers (explanation: this reduces complex horizontal runs, minimizing material costs and potential for sags). I then design the water supply system, often recommending a home run PEX manifold system (example), explaining that it provides balanced pressure to each fixture and simplifies isolating individual supply lines for repair, which lessens the impact of a single fixture issue on the entire system. However, a potential risk is that excessive PEX runs could increase material cost slightly, which I mitigate by optimizing manifold placement. For the DWV system, I ensure all traps are properly vented (e.g., using an individual vent for each fixture, explanation: this prevents siphoning and back-pressure, crucial for preventing sewer gas entry), but acknowledge the risk of improper vent termination leading to freezing or blockages, which I counter by specifying appropriate roof penetrations and insulation. In summary, my design prioritizes efficiency, code adherence, and system longevity while proactively addressing common residential plumbing risks.",

    "output": "Deploying machine learning models can seem intimidating at first, but once you break down the process, it’s surprisingly simple. Whether you’re deploying a model on your own production environment or pushing it to an existing deployment system, the steps to do so are straightforward. To make the process easier, we’ve outlined the most important steps for deploying a machine learning model.\n\nFirst, you need to package your model. This means creating a container environment. You can use a platform such as Docker to quickly get a container setup. This will allow you to easily create a reproducible build environment that includes all of your model’s dependencies.\n\nNext, you need to create a deployment environment. Typically, this would be a cloud-based platform such as Amazon Web Services. This allows you to easily provision compute and storage resources without having to manage them manually.\n\nThird, you should set up a continuous integration system. This will allow you to easily test the model in production and get immediate feedback on the model’s performance. You can use Jenkins, Travis CI, or any other Continuous Integration (CI) platform.\n\nFourth, you should test and deploy the model. This is where you can use your CI system to test the model in a production environment. If the tests come back successful, you can deploy the model to production.\n\nFinally, you should monitor the model for performance. This is especially important for machine learning models, as their performance can vary greatly from time to time. You can use a monitoring tool such as Splunk or Datadog to track different metrics such as accuracy rate and inference time.\n\nBy following these steps, you can deploy your machine learning model quickly and efficiently. If you need help with any of these steps, you can always reach out to an experienced team of engineers who can make sure your model is deployed correctly.",

By adopting active voice ('Our team identified errors,' 'The finance department allocated funds'), communication drastically improved, leading to faster decision-making. Following this principle, rewrite the provided paragraph in active voice to achieve similar clarity and directness.",
    "instruct_with_citations": "Rewrite the following paragraph in the active voice. Ensure your rewrite adheres to the principles of active voice as recommended by authoritative style guides (e.g., The Chicago Manual of Style or APA Publication Manual). You may cite specific rules or examples from such guides to justify your transformations if helpful.",
    "instruct_with_counterarguments": "Rewrite the following paragraph in the active voice. While some argue that passive voice can be useful for objectivity (e.g., in scientific writing where the action is more important than the actor) or to avoid assigning blame, the general consensus for clear communication favors active voice. Please proceed with the conversion, keeping these counterarguments in mind but prioritizing directness.",
    "instruct_with_detailed_instructions": "Your task is to comprehensively rewrite the entire provided paragraph, meticulously converting every instance of passive voice into active voice. For each sentence:\n1.  Identify the verb. If it's a 'to be' verb (is, am, are, was, were, be, being, been) followed by a past participle (e.g., 'seen,' 'done,' 'written'), it's likely passive.\n2.  Determine the actual 'doer' or agent of the action, even if it's currently hidden in a 'by' phrase or implied.\n3.  Restructure the sentence so that this 'doer' becomes the subject of the verb.\n4.  Ensure the verb form is appropriate for the new active subject and tense.\n5.  Verify that the original meaning is preserved and the sentence flows naturally.\nApply these steps rigorously to produce a clear, direct, and fully active-voice paragraph.",
    "instruct_with_emotional_appeal": "Unleash the power and clarity hidden within the following paragraph! Passive voice can make your message dull and obscure. Transform it into active voice to bring your words to life, making them resonate powerfully and clearly with your audience. Inject vitality and directness into every sentence!",
    "instruct_with_examples": "Rewrite the following paragraph in the active voice. For example, if a sentence reads 'The decision was made by the committee,' you should change it to 'The committee made the decision.' Apply similar transformations to all passive constructions in the given text.",
    "instruct_with_examples_and_explanations": "Rewrite the following paragraph in active voice. Active voice means the subject of the sentence performs the action. For instance, 'The ball was thrown by the boy' is passive because the ball (subject) receives the action. The active equivalent, 'The boy threw the ball,' makes the boy (the doer) the subject. Apply this understanding to convert each sentence in the paragraph.",
    "instruct_with_helpful_explanations": "Rewrite the following paragraph in the active voice. To do this, focus on identifying who or what is performing the action in each sentence. If the sentence structure emphasizes the recipient of the action (e.g., 'The report was written' instead of 'Someone wrote the report'), it's likely passive. Your goal is to rephrase it so the 'doer' becomes the subject, making the sentence more direct and usually shorter.",
    "instruct_with_metaphors": "Rewrite the following paragraph in the active voice. Imagine passive voice as a cloaked figure, obscuring the true actor. Your task is to uncloak it, making the subject a clear, visible protagonist driving the action, not merely a recipient. Transform the paragraph, ensuring every sentence's 'hero' performs the deed.",

It will feel so much more direct and impactful, I promise. Could you please take the time to convert all the passive constructions, making the sentences clearer and stronger?",
    "instruct_with_rebuttals": "Rewrite the following paragraph in the active voice. While it's sometimes argued that passive voice is more formal or objective, this claim is often rebutted by the fact that active voice typically enhances clarity, conciseness, and reader engagement without sacrificing professionalism. Please proceed with the conversion, aiming for the directness that active voice provides.",
    "instruct_with_similes": "Rewrite the following paragraph in the active voice. Active voice is like a direct arrow hitting its target, clear and precise. Passive voice, however, is like a boomerang, going around before reaching its point. Make your sentences direct and impactful, like those arrows, by converting them to active voice.",
    "instruct_with_statistics": "Studies show that active voice improves readability by up to 30% and enhances comprehension significantly. Businesses using active voice in communications report 15% clearer instructions. Based on these statistics, please rewrite the following paragraph in the active voice to maximize its clarity and impact.",
    "instruct_with_step_by_step": "To rewrite the following paragraph in active voice, follow these steps:\n1.  Read each sentence carefully and identify the main verb.\n2.  Check if the verb is in a passive construction (e.g., a form of 'to be' + a past participle, often with 'by').\n3.  Identify the agent or performer of the action (who or what is doing the verb).\n4.  Restructure the sentence so that this agent becomes the subject, performing the action directly.\n5.  Rewrite the entire paragraph, applying these changes to all passive sentences.",
    "instruct_with_summary": "Rewrite the following paragraph in the active voice. In summary, your goal is to make the subject of each sentence the performer of the action, which will result in clearer, more direct, and often more concise prose.",
    "instruct_with_technical_details": "Analyze the deep syntactic structure of the provided paragraph. Your task is to apply a full voice transformation, specifically converting all verb phrases from passive to active constructions.

For example, if expressing cause, instead of 'so' (which is often vague), use 'consequently' or 'as a result' (which precisely signals a direct outcome). If showing contrast, 'but' (common) could become 'nevertheless' or 'on the other hand' (more formal and nuanced). Choose a transition that precisely articulates the relationship.",
    "instruct_with_helpful_explanations": "A good transition helps readers understand the precise relationship between ideas, preventing abrupt shifts and ensuring logical progression. Please improve the following sentence by choosing a transition that clearly signals the connection (e.g., cause/effect, contrast, addition, sequence) to the surrounding text, thereby enhancing overall comprehension.",
    "instruct_with_metaphors": "Transitions are the invisible threads weaving the tapestry of your prose. Strengthen the fabric of your writing, ensuring a cohesive and elegant composition, by improving the provided sentence with a more robust and finely spun transitional thread.",
    "instruct_with_personal_touch": "I'm looking forward to seeing your linguistic finesse! Please take a moment to truly enhance this sentence for me by revamping it with a transition that really elevates its flow, precision, and overall impact.",
    "instruct_with_rebuttals": "While some critics suggest that extensive transitional work can lead to wordiness, this argument fails to acknowledge the critical role of clarity. A poorly chosen or absent transition can significantly disrupt flow, actively hindering reader comprehension. Therefore, demonstrate superior writing by improving the provided sentence with a distinctly better transition.",
    "instruct_with_similes": "A good transition acts like a smooth gear shift in a well-tuned car, making the reader's journey through your text effortless. Improve the given sentence by choosing a better transition, allowing ideas to flow as smoothly and logically as water over polished stones.",
    "instruct_with_statistics": "Studies show that clear, cohesive writing, largely attributed to effective transitions, improves reader comprehension rates by up to 30% and reduces cognitive load by 15%. To contribute to this demonstrable clarity and efficiency, refine the given sentence by implementing a more effective transitional element.",
    "instruct_with_step_by_step": "Step 1: Carefully read the sentence and the context in which it appears to understand the logical relationship between its parts. Step 2: Brainstorm several transitional words or phrases that precisely convey this identified relationship (e.g., causality, contrast, addition). Step 3: Select the most accurate, concise, and natural-sounding option. Step 4: Integrate the chosen transition into the sentence. Apply these steps to improve the given sentence by using a better transition.",
    "instruct_with_summary": "Summary: Clear and precise transitions are fundamental for creating readable and logical text. Please improve the following sentence by using a better transition to ensure smooth, understandable flow between ideas and enhance overall coherence.",
    "instruct_with_technical_details": "Focus on refining the given sentence by selecting a sophisticated transitional phrase or conjunctive adverb that precisely articulates the specific logical relationship (e.g., causality, concession, enumeration, sequence, exemplification) between independent clauses or paragraphs, thereby enhancing textual cohesion and semantic accuracy.",
