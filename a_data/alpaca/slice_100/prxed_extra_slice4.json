    "instruct_with_counterarguments": "When selecting the best prediction for \"My vacation is in ________,\" consider the immediate context. While some sentences might seem superficially plausible (e.g., \"My vacation is in doubt.\"), evaluate if they truly serve as a *completion* that fills the blank with a *location or time*, rather than just a status. Focus on the most direct and common interpretations of 'vacation location/time'.",
    "instruct_with_detailed_instructions": "Your objective is to identify the singular most appropriate and contextually fitting prediction to complete the phrase \"My vacation is in ________\" from a given set of candidate sentences. When evaluating each sentence, prioritize completions that denote a specific time (e.g., month, season, year) or a geographical location (e.g., city, country, region), as these are the most common and direct ways to specify a vacation's setting.

For instance, if options are \"My vacation is in July.\" and \"My vacation is in the refrigerator.\", the first is clearly better. If options are \"My vacation is in Europe.\" and \"My vacation is in winter.\", both are plausible but the context of surrounding sentences might make one 'best'.",
    "instruct_with_examples_and_explanations": "Select the best prediction for \"My vacation is in ________.\" For example, if you had \"My vacation is in August.\" and \"My vacation is in the air.\", \"August\" is better because 'in' with vacation commonly denotes a time or place, not a state of being like 'in the air' (unless referring to travel *method*, which is less direct).",
    "instruct_with_helpful_explanations": "To select the best prediction for \"My vacation is in ________,\" consider what kind of information typically follows 'in' when discussing a vacation.

    "instruct_with_examples_and_explanations": "Convert the provided sentence into a question. For example, if the original sentence is 'The train leaves at noon,' you would transform it into 'Does the train leave at noon?' The explanation here is that 'does' is added as an auxiliary verb, and 'leaves' reverts to its base form 'leave' because 'does' carries the tense. Another example: 'They are building a house' becomes 'Are they building a house?' In this case, the existing auxiliary verb 'are' is simply moved to the beginning of the sentence.",
    "instruct_with_helpful_explanations": "To convert the provided sentence into a question, consider its main verb and subject. If there's an auxiliary verb (like 'is', 'can', 'have'), you typically move it to the start of the sentence (e.g., 'He is here' -> 'Is he here?'). If there's no auxiliary in the simple present or past tense, you'll need to introduce a form of 'do' ('do', 'does', 'did') and ensure the main verb is in its base form (e.g., 'They eat pizza' -> 'Do they eat pizza?'). Always end with a question mark. Apply these principles thoughtfully.",

If so, move it to the beginning of the sentence before the subject. Step 3: If no auxiliary verb is present (and the main verb is in simple present or past tense), add the appropriate form of 'do' (do/does/did) to the beginning of the sentence, and change the main verb to its base form. Step 4: Replace the period or other end punctuation with a question mark.",
