We have also come to realize though, that the virus only targets those who aren’t following specific protocols. Wearing a face covering, washing your hands and staying home has proven to be the ultimate remedy – the only thing standing in the way of avoiding infection. Taking preventive measures has significantly reduced the spread of the virus, and yet, people are still getting sick. Is this virus selectively choosing who to infect? It just doesn’t make sense!
