For instance, `[5, 1, 2, 5]` sorted becomes `[1, 2, 5, 5]`. Here, `5` is the duplicate, but its original 'first' occurrence was at index 0, and its second at index 3. Sorting makes this contextual information irretrievable for the definition of 'first repeating element'. The O(n) approach with a hash set or frequency map is superior for this specific requirement.\n\n**Analogies:**\n*   Think of it like being a detective walking down a street, looking for the first person you see twice. If you spot a person (let's say 'Alice') and later see her again, but before that, you also spotted 'Bob' for the first time and then saw him again even earlier than Alice's second appearance, then Bob is your 'first repeating person'. You're looking for the earliest 'aha!' moment of recognition.\n\n**Metaphors:**\n*   Your array is a winding river, and you're searching for the first eddy where a specific piece of flotsam circles back, earlier than any other piece of flotsam circles back in its own eddy. You're not looking for all the eddies, just the very first one to form from a re-encountered item.",

For scientific writing, clarity often improves by stating the actor, even if it's \"We\" or \"The researchers.\" Strategic use differs from default reliance.\n*   **Analogy:** Think of a play. Passive voice is like watching a scene where you see the effects on the stage but don't clearly see who's causing them, or the actors are hidden backstage. Active voice is like having the actors front and center, clearly performing their roles and driving the plot forward. It brings the action to life directly.",
    "instruct_condensed_then_expand_with_examples_and_explanations_and_summary_and_risks_and_benefits_and_references_and_citations_and_counterarguments_and_rebuttals_and_analogies_and_metaphors": "Active voice conversion: Rewrite the sentence so the subject acts. \n\n*   **Explanation:** Active voice emphasizes the doer of an action, making sentences more direct and often more concise than passive voice. To convert, identify who or what is performing the action, then restructure the sentence to place that agent before the verb.\n*   **Examples with Explanations:**\n    *   Passive: \"The decision was approved by the board.\" (Explanation: The board is the agent, but the sentence structure prioritizes the decision.)\n    *   Active: \"The board approved the decision.\" (Explanation: The board becomes the subject, making the action direct and clear.)\n*   **Summary:** Active voice enhances clarity, directness, and conciseness by placing the agent of the action as the sentence's subject, resulting in more impactful and engaging prose.\n*   **Risks:** Over-reliance can make writing monotonous. In contexts where the agent is unknown, irrelevant, or for scientific objectivity, passive voice might be intentionally used.\n*   **Benefits:** Active voice promotes engaging, unambiguous, and often shorter sentences. It clearly attributes actions, fostering stronger communication and accountability.\n*   **References & Citations:**\n    *   Purdue OWL. (n.d.). *Active and Passive Voice*.

B. (1999). *The Elements of Style* (4th ed.). Pearson. (A key reference for clear writing).\n*   **Counterarguments:** Passive voice can be appropriate when the actor is unknown, irrelevant, or when focusing on the action itself (e.g., \"The experiment was repeated\"). It's also used for formality or to avoid attributing blame.\n*   **Rebuttals:** While passive voice has niche uses, its habitual application often leads to weak, wordy, and evasive writing. The clarity gained by foregrounding the actor generally outweighs these specific exceptions, which can often be rephrased actively without losing meaning.\n*   **Analogy:** Consider a detective story. Passive voice is like saying, \"The window was broken.\" You know something happened, but you don't know who did it. Active voice is like saying, \"The burglar broke the window.\" You immediately know the perpetrator, making the narrative much clearer and more direct.\n*   **Metaphor:** Active voice is the engine of your sentence, propelling the action forward with a clear, powerful thrust. Passive voice is like a broken rudder, leaving your sentence adrift and lacking direction, obscuring the true force behind the movement.",

A counterargument is that rephrasing can never perfectly capture all original nuances, especially with idiomatic expressions, leading to semantic leakage. However, a rebuttal is that careful lexical and structural choices, informed by deep semantic understanding (e.g., as outlined in Saeed, J. I. (2003). 'Semantics.'

Your thought process would then detail: '1. Subject: 'complex algorithm' -> 'intricate computational procedure'. Explanation: 'complex' and 'intricate' are synonymous here; 'algorithm' is a specific computational procedure. 2. Action: 'processed' -> 'handled/analyzed'. Explanation: 'processed' implies a methodical handling of data. 3. Object: 'vast datasets' -> 'extensive collections of information'. Explanation: 'vast' and 'extensive' are synonyms; 'datasets' are specific collections of information. 4. Manner: 'efficiently' -> 'with high efficacy/effectiveness'.

Your thought process would detail: '1. Subject: 'digital transformation' -> 'technological shift towards digital processes.' 2. Action: 'is accelerating' -> 'is increasing in pace.' 3. Object: 'industries' -> 'various sectors.' This leads to 'The technological shift towards digital processes in various sectors is increasing in pace.' Explanation: Each component has been replaced with a semantically equivalent phrase, ensuring no meaning is lost. A significant risk in such rephrasing is semantic drift, where subtle connotations are inadvertently altered, or ambiguity is introduced.
