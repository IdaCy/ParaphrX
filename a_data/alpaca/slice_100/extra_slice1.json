    "output": "The Cuban Missile Crisis and the Vietnam War were two of the largest and deadliest conflicts of the 20th century. The Cuban Missile Crisis involved a standoff between the United States and the Soviet Union over Soviet nuclear missile bases in Cuba, while the Vietnam War was a prolonged military conflict in Indochina between the North, which was backed by the Soviet Union and the South, which was backed by the United States. The Cuban Missile Crisis unfolded over a period of 13 days in October 1962, with the resolution coming in the form of a diplomatic agreement. The Vietnam War lasted for 19 years, beginning in 1954 and ending in 1973, with the signing of the Paris Peace Accords. While both of these conflicts were Cold War related, they were also very different in terms of causes, objectives, strategic objectives and outcomes. The Cuban Missile Crisis did not result in any direct military conflict and was resolved primarily through diplomacy and the decision to withdraw nuclear weapons from Cuba. On the other hand, the Vietnam War was a prolonged series of battles resulting in significant losses for both sides. The Vietnam War also had a significant impact on the United States, as it highlighted the realities of a prolonged conflict and the limits of U.S. military intervention. Additionally, the Vietnam War also drastically changed the way public opinion viewed the military and the use of force.",

    "output": "The Battle of Waterloo, fought on June 18, 1815, was the last major battle of the Napoleonic Wars. It marked the end of Napoleon Bonaparte's rule. The battle was fought between Napoleon Bonaparte's French forces and an allied force of British, Dutch, Belgian and Prussian troops, led by the Duke of Wellington. It was fought near the town of Waterloo in the former Austrian Netherlands, now present-day Belgium. The battle was a defeat for Napoleon's forces and ended Napoleon's rule over France. Napoleon himself was exiled to St. Helena, where he would die in 1821. The battle marked the end of French domination of Europe and the beginning of a period of peace in the region. It was also the last major battle of the Napoleonic Wars and is remembered as one of the most important battles in history. The victory of the allied forces at Waterloo helped to bring an end to French imperial ambitions in Europe. It also established the British as one of the most powerful nations in Europe. The battle was fought with a combination of infantry, cavalry, and artillery tactics, and showed the beginning of the changing nature of warfare. Although the French forces greatly outnumbered the allies, their strategic and tactical mistake led to the loss of the battle. This defeat signaled the end of French imperial power in Europe. The legacy of Waterloo still stands today, and it cemented the British Empire's position for the next one hundred years.",

    "output": "Cogging torque is the torque that is applied to a rotating device when the device experiences resistance from the teeth of the gears that are connected to the device. Cogging torque occurs due to the reaction force generated when the teeth of the gear drive mesh. This force pushes against each other, resulting in a drag force that is transmitted from the gears to the shaft. The magnitude of the cogging torque can vary depending on the size and number of teeth, as well as the gear's material and design. Cogging torque is undesirable in most motorized applications, as it can lead to loss of efficiency. To reduce cogging torque, gear designs are often symmetrical or have certain tooth profiles which reduce the force of contact between the teeth when they come into contact with each other.",

The process begins when the plant takes in carbon dioxide from the environment and combines it with water to form glucose molecules using the energy from sunlight. This glucose is then broken down into simpler molecules of carbon dioxide and water. During this process, the energy released is used to produce adenosine triphosphate (ATP) molecules. ATP is used by the plant to power other processes, such as growth and reproduction. Additionally, the ATP can also be broken down further to produce heat energy, which helps to sustain the plant's temperature. The carbon dioxide and water molecules produced in the process are then released back into the environment to complete the cycle.",

    "output": "Deforestation is the process of clearing and removing forests. The consequences of deforestation can include soil erosion, reduced water quality, decreased biodiversity, increased carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and loss of habitat for wildlife. Soil erosion occurs when the trees that help retain water and soil are removed, leading to soil particles being washed away. This can cause siltation in rivers and streams, affecting water quality and leading to flooding. Additionally, when trees are removed, wildlife lose their habitat. This can cause species to become endangered, leading to further loss of biodiversity. Deforestation can also lead to increased carbon dioxide in the atmosphere as there are fewer trees to take up the gas during photosynthesis, which can contribute to climate change.",

The acting is fantastic, particularly Song Kang-ho as the head of the poor household, and the cinematography is stunning. The movie has a perfect balance of humor and thought-provoking drama, and it will leave you talking about the ending for days afterwards. Overall, I highly recommend Parasite; it is an exceptional movie and an experience you won't soon forget.",
