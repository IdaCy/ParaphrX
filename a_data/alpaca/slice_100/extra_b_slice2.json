First, I will identify any first-person or second-person pronouns and verb conjugations. For example, in \"I run quickly,\" 'I' is first person. Second, I will select an appropriate third-person pronoun (e.g., \"he,\" \"she,\" \"they,\" or a suitable noun) and adjust the verb for agreement. So, \"I run quickly\" would become \"He runs quickly.\" Based on this methodology, please rewrite the provided sentence into the third-person point of view.",
    "instruct_role_expert_cot_with_examples_and_explanations": "As an authority on grammatical transformations, I will carefully explain the process of rewriting a sentence into the third-person point of view. Consider the sentence \"I walk to the park.\" Here, \"I\" is a first-person pronoun, directly involving the speaker. To convert this, we replace \"I\" with a third-person pronoun like \"he,\" \"she,\" \"it,\" or \"they,\" or a specific noun. The verb \"walk\" must then be conjugated to agree with this new subject; for \"he,\" it becomes \"walks.\" So, the sentence becomes \"He walks to the park.\" This transformation moves the perspective from the speaker's direct experience to an external observation, which is crucial for achieving an objective tone. Apply this expert approach to rewrite the given sentence.",
    "instruct_role_expert_cot_with_examples_and_explanations_and_summary": "As a linguistic expert, I will guide you through the process of converting a sentence to the third-person point of view. The core idea is to shift the narrative from a direct, involved perspective to an external, objective one. For instance, if the original sentence is \"I feel happy,\" the first-person pronoun \"I\" indicates the speaker's direct experience. To convert this, we replace \"I\" with a third-person subject, such as \"she\" or \"the person.\" The verb \"feel\" must then be adjusted for subject-verb agreement, becoming \"feels.\" So, \"She feels happy\" or \"The person feels happy.\" This process effectively removes personal bias, making the statement more general and formal. In summary, you will transform the sentence by replacing subjective pronouns with objective ones and adjusting verb forms accordingly.

The fundamental goal is to shift the narrative perspective from an internal, subjective 'I' or 'you' to an external, objective 'he,' 'she,' 'it,' or 'they.' For example, if the sentence is \"I consider this important,\" the \"I\" should be replaced with a third-person subject, such as \"She,\" and the verb \"consider\" adjusted to \"considers,\" resulting in \"She considers this important.\" This is explained by the need to maintain grammatical agreement while externalizing the subject.

    "instruct_role_expert_cot": "As a seasoned linguist and editor, my approach to lexical substitution prioritizes semantic precision and contextual appropriateness. I will first analyze the target sentence to grasp its complete meaning. Then, I will identify a word whose replacement would enhance the sentence without altering its core message.

Finally, I will integrate the new word and verify that the sentence maintains its original intent and flow.",

For instance, if the sentence is 'The large building stood tall', I might choose to replace 'large' with ' विशाल' or 'expansive', resulting in 'The expansive building stood tall'. This process involves identifying a word for substitution, exploring its synonyms, and selecting the most fitting alternative to preserve the original meaning while offering stylistic variation.",

'Cheerful' is also good, but 'gleeful' might imply too intense an emotion for the context. This process ensures the chosen word is not just similar, but optimal for the sentence's context.",

    "instruct_role_expert_cot_with_examples": "As a seasoned linguistic expert, your task is to precisely rewrite the following sentence, ensuring its original meaning remains completely intact. Utilize a Chain-of-Thought approach to detail your process. For example, if the original is 'The dog barked loudly,' you might think: 'Identify core components: 'dog' (subject), 'barked' (action), 'loudly' (manner). Brainstorm synonyms: 'dog' -> 'canine,' 'barked' -> 'howled/yelped,' 'loudly' -> 'vociferously/noisily.' Synthesize: 'The canine howled vociferously.'

Employ a Chain-of-Thought process, explaining your reasoning for each rephrasing decision. For instance, if the original sentence is 'The burgeoning economy led to increased employment,' your thought process might be: 1. Identify core subject and action: 'economy' (subject), 'led to' (causation). 2. Identify key modifiers/results: 'burgeoning' (adjective), 'increased employment' (noun phrase). 3. Brainstorm semantic equivalents: 'burgeoning' -> 'growing/expanding/developing'; 'led to' -> 'resulted in/caused'; 'increased employment' -> 'job growth/more jobs.' 4. Synthesize: 'The developing economy resulted in job growth.' This rigorous approach ensures meaning preservation by systematically replacing components with equivalents.

For example, if the original is 'The complex algorithm efficiently processed vast datasets,' your summary might be: 'I will focus on preserving the subject's action and its qualifiers.' Your thought process would then detail: '1. Subject: 'complex algorithm' -> 'intricate computational procedure'. Explanation: 'complex' and 'intricate' are synonymous here; 'algorithm' is a specific computational procedure. 2. Action: 'processed' -> 'handled/analyzed'. Explanation: 'processed' implies a methodical handling of data. 3. Object: 'vast datasets' -> 'extensive collections of information'. Explanation: 'vast' and 'extensive' are synonyms; 'datasets' are specific collections of information. 4. Manner: 'efficiently' -> 'with high efficacy/effectiveness'. Explanation: 'efficiently' describes the quality of the processing. This leads to: 'The intricate computational procedure efficiently handled extensive collections of information.'

For instance, if the original sentence is 'The digital transformation of industries is accelerating rapidly,' your summary might be: 'My approach will focus on preserving the core concepts of technological change and speed.' Your thought process would detail: '1. Subject: 'digital transformation' -> 'technological shift towards digital processes.' 2. Action: 'is accelerating' -> 'is increasing in pace.' 3. Object: 'industries' -> 'various sectors.' This leads to 'The technological shift towards digital processes in various sectors is increasing in pace.' Explanation: Each component has been replaced with a semantically equivalent phrase, ensuring no meaning is lost. A significant risk in such rephrasing is semantic drift, where subtle connotations are inadvertently altered, or ambiguity is introduced. For example, simply saying 'Industry is changing fast' loses the specific 'digital transformation' aspect. Another risk is over-simplification, which can strip away crucial detail.",

Read the original sentence carefully to grasp its full literal and implied meaning, including all subject, verb, object relationships, modifiers, and any idiomatic expressions. 2. Identify the core message or propositional content. 3. Break down the sentence into its constituent semantic units. 4. Brainstorm alternative vocabulary (synonyms) for each key word or phrase. 5. Consider different grammatical structures (e.g., active to passive voice, noun phrases to verb phrases, complex to compound sentences) that could convey the same information. 6. Reassemble these new words and structures into a new sentence. 7. Compare your rewritten sentence meticulously against the original, asking: 'Does it say *exactly* the same thing?

    "instruct_with_examples_and_explanations": "Rewrite the following sentence, ensuring that its original meaning is perfectly preserved. For example, if the original is 'The rapid growth of technology revolutionized communication,' a valid rewrite could be 'Technological advancements quickly transformed how we communicate.' This works because 'rapid growth' is explained by 'quickly,' 'revolutionized' by 'transformed,' and 'communication' by 'how we communicate,' all while retaining the core message. Avoid rewrites like 'Technology sometimes changes communication,' as this alters the meaning and certainty.",
    "instruct_with_helpful_explanations": "To rewrite the following sentence while preserving its meaning, think of it as finding a different path to the same destination.
