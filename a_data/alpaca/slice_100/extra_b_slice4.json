It involves altering a sentence's grammatical structure to indicate an inquiry rather than an assertion. Bearing this context in mind, please transform the given sentence into a question.",
    "instruct_with_analogies": "Transform the given sentence into a question. Think of it like taking a declarative statement, which is a closed book, and opening it up to invite conversation. You're changing its 'stance' from stating to asking, similar to how you might re-angle a camera lens to capture a different perspective.",
    "instruct_with_case_studies": "Consider a scenario: A team member states, 'The project is delayed.' To understand why and what steps to take, a manager needs to transform this into an inquiry. How would you convert this statement into a question that efficiently seeks the necessary information? Apply this thinking to transform the given sentence into a clear and effective question.",
    "instruct_with_citations": "Convert the provided sentence into a question. This transformation typically involves subject-auxiliary inversion, the addition of a 'do'-support auxiliary, or the use of wh-words, concluding with an interrogative punctuation mark (Quirk et al., 1985). Ensure your transformed sentence adheres to these grammatical principles.",
    "instruct_with_counterarguments": "While simply stating facts can be direct, converting a sentence into a question might seem like an unnecessary extra step, potentially diluting directness or making the communication longer. However, questions are vital for engagement and information gathering. Despite potential concerns about conciseness, please transform the given sentence into a question.",
    "instruct_with_detailed_instructions": "To transform the given sentence into a question, follow these detailed steps: First, identify the main verb and subject. Second, check if an auxiliary verb (like 'is,' 'are,' 'was,' 'were,' 'have,' 'has,' 'had,' 'can,' 'will,' 'should,' etc.) is present. If an auxiliary verb exists, move it to the beginning of the sentence, before the subject. If no auxiliary verb is present and the main verb is in the simple present or simple past tense, introduce the appropriate form of 'do' ('do,' 'does,' or 'did') at the beginning of the sentence, and ensure the main verb reverts to its base form. Finally, replace the period with a question mark.",

    "instruct_with_examples_and_explanations": "Convert the provided sentence into a question. For example, if the original sentence is 'The train leaves at noon,' you would transform it into 'Does the train leave at noon?' The explanation here is that 'does' is added as an auxiliary verb, and 'leaves' reverts to its base form 'leave' because 'does' carries the tense. Another example: 'They are building a house' becomes 'Are they building a house?' In this case, the existing auxiliary verb 'are' is simply moved to the beginning of the sentence.",
    "instruct_with_helpful_explanations": "To convert the provided sentence into a question, consider its main verb and subject. If there's an auxiliary verb (like 'is', 'can', 'have'), you typically move it to the start of the sentence (e.g., 'He is here' -> 'Is he here?'). If there's no auxiliary in the simple present or past tense, you'll need to introduce a form of 'do' ('do', 'does', 'did') and ensure the main verb is in its base form (e.g., 'They eat pizza' -> 'Do they eat pizza?'). Always end with a question mark. Apply these principles thoughtfully.",
    "instruct_with_metaphors": "Transform the given sentence into a question.

    "instruct_role_expert_cot": "As a seasoned linguist, my thought process for this task involves identifying potential noun phrases in the given sentence. I then determine if the context or common usage implies a specific, unique, or previously introduced entity that warrants a definite article. Finally, I will strategically place 'the' to ensure grammatical accuracy and clarity, converting an indefinite reference to a definite one. Apply this methodology to the upcoming sentence.",
    "instruct_role_expert_cot_with_examples": "As a grammar expert, my process is to first pinpoint the general noun phrases in the sentence. Then, I consider if the context implies a specific instance that needs 'the'. For example, if the sentence is 'I went to store,' 'store' is general. My thought is: 'Which store?' If it's a specific, known store, I add 'the': 'I went to the store.' Similarly, 'Sun is bright' requires 'the' because 'Sun' is unique: 'The sun is bright.' Apply this expert reasoning to the provided sentence.",

My internal rationale for adding 'the' is based on whether the noun is singular, common, and intended to refer to a specific, unique, or contextually known entity. For instance, in 'She read book,' 'book' is general. Explanation: To make it definite, as in 'She read the book,' it implies a particular book. Another example: 'Sky is blue.' 'Sky' is unique, so 'The sky is blue' is correct. Explanation: 'The' is essential for unique references. Apply this careful analysis to the sentence you provide.",
