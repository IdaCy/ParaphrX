I will specifically look for words that modify verbs, adjectives, or other adverbs. These are words that answer questions like how (quickly), when (yesterday), where (here), or to what extent (very). For instance, words like 'quickly,' 'very,' and 'here' often function as adverbs. My process involves careful examination of each word's role in the sentence. A minor risk is misidentifying a word used in an unusual context or a 'flat adverb' (one without -ly) as another part of speech.

    "instruct_with_helpful_explanations": "Adverbs are fascinating words! They add color and detail by modifying verbs (how, when, where, why?), adjectives (how much?), or even other adverbs. They often end in -ly, but not always. With that in mind, can you please identify all the adverbs in the sentence provided?",
    "instruct_with_metaphors": "Adverbs are the seasoning of a sentence, adding flavor and depth to the main ingredients (verbs, adjectives). Just as seasoning enhances a dish, adverbs enhance the meaning of the words they modify. Please find these 'seasonings' in the following sentence.",

Please apply this understanding to identify the adverbs in the following sentence.",
    "instruct_with_similes": "Adverbs are like descriptive brushstrokes on the canvas of a sentence, adding detail to the main subjects.

We have also come to realize though, that the virus only targets those who aren’t following specific protocols. Wearing a face covering, washing your hands and staying home has proven to be the ultimate remedy – the only thing standing in the way of avoiding infection. Taking preventive measures has significantly reduced the spread of the virus, and yet, people are still getting sick. Is this virus selectively choosing who to infect? It just doesn’t make sense! We may never know the answer, but at least we can attempt to stay safe and healthy.",
