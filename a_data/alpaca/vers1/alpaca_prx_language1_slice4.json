Deep learning based text processing uses algorithms to learn from datasets and extract patterns from text. It is able to process text with high accuracy and at a much faster rate than rule-based text processing. Deep learning models are also more flexible and can be adapted to different tasks with little effort. Deep learning is thus better suited for more complex text processing tasks.",

We have also come to realize though, that the virus only targets those who aren’t following specific protocols. Wearing a face covering, washing your hands and staying home has proven to be the ultimate remedy – the only thing standing in the way of avoiding infection. Taking preventive measures has significantly reduced the spread of the virus, and yet, people are still getting sick. Is this virus selectively choosing who to infect? It just doesn’t make sense!
