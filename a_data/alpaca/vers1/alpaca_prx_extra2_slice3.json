    "instruct_socratic_dialogue": "Consider the sentence provided. Is the grammatical subject of the sentence the entity performing the main action, or is the action being done *to* the subject? If it is the latter, what entity *is* performing the action? How might we restructure the sentence to highlight this active agent at the beginning?",
    "instruct_step_rationale": "Rewrite the following sentence in active voice. Provide a brief rationale for each step taken in the transformation, e.g., 'Step 1: Identify the passive verb phrase ('was written'). Rationale: This signals passive voice.

    "instruct_summary_then_detail": "Rewrite the sentence into active voice.\n\nDetail: To achieve this, identify the subject that performs the action. Ensure this subject is at the beginning of the sentence, followed by the active verb. Eliminate passive constructions involving forms of 'to be' and past participles where the subject receives the action.",
    "instruct_validator_pass": "Rewrite the following sentence in active voice. The rewritten sentence must pass a conceptual 'active voice validator' check, meaning its structure clearly demonstrates the subject performing the main action, without reliance on passive constructions like 'is done by' or 'was seen by'.",
    "instruct_with_additional_context": "Rewriting sentences into active voice is a fundamental technique to improve clarity and impact in writing. It emphasizes the doer of the action, making prose more direct and engaging. Please apply this technique by rewriting the following sentence to ensure it is in active voice.",
    "instruct_with_analogies": "Think of a sentence like a story about something happening. Passive voice is like telling the story from the perspective of the thing the action happens *to*. Active voice is like telling it from the perspective of the person or thing *doing* the action. Rewrite the provided sentence so it tells the story from the perspective of the doer, just like a movie focusing on the hero.",
    "instruct_with_case_studies": "Consider the case of Acme Corp.'s recent report. Initial drafts used extensive passive voice ('The market was analyzed,' 'Costs were reduced'). Rewriting key sections into active voice ('Our team analyzed the market,' 'Management reduced costs') significantly improved readability and accountability. Apply this lesson by rewriting the following sentence into active voice.",
    "instruct_with_citations": "Rewrite the provided sentence into active voice, a common recommendation for clearer writing [1, 2]. Active voice typically follows a Subject-Verb-Object structure where the subject performs the action [3].\n\n[1] Strunk Jr., W., & White, E. B. (2000). *The Elements of Style* (4th ed.).

    "instruct_with_counterarguments": "Rewrite the following sentence into active voice. While passive voice can sometimes be useful (e.g., when the actor is unknown or unimportant), frequent use often leads to weak, unclear sentences. Aim for active voice unless there's a strong reason for passive.",
    "instruct_with_detailed_instructions": "Your task is to convert the grammatical structure of the following sentence from its current state (likely passive voice) to active voice. Follow these steps precisely:\n1.  Read the original sentence carefully and identify the core action or verb.\n2.  Determine which entity or person is *performing* that action (the actor).\n3.  Make that actor the new subject of your rewritten sentence.\n4.  Ensure the verb form is appropriate for the active subject and tense.\n5.  Place the recipient of the action (the object) after the verb, if applicable.\n6.  Remove any 'to be' verbs (is, am, are, was, were, be, being, been) and the 'by' phrase associated with the passive structure.\n7.  Write the complete sentence using the new active voice structure.",

    "instruct_with_examples_and_explanations": "Rewrite the following sentence into active voice. This means changing the sentence structure so the subject performs the action, rather than receiving it. For instance, 'The report was written by Alex' (passive voice - the report receives the action) becomes 'Alex wrote the report' (active voice - Alex performs the action).",
    "instruct_with_helpful_explanations": "To rewrite the sentence in active voice, focus on identifying the 'doer' of the action. In passive voice, the subject receives the action ('The cake was eaten'). In active voice, the subject performs the action ('I ate the cake'). Find who or what is doing the verb's action in your sentence and structure it Subject-Verb-Object.",

    "instruct_with_rebuttals": "Rewrite the following sentence in active voice. While some argue passive voice is sometimes needed for objectivity or when the actor is unknown, overuse weakens writing. In most cases, rewriting in active voice is preferable for clarity and impact, and often the actor *can* be identified or implied.",

    "instruct_with_step_by_step": "Here's how to rewrite the sentence in active voice:\n1. Read the sentence and find the main verb.\n2. Ask yourself 'Who or what is performing this action?' That's your active subject.\n3. If the original subject receives the action, move the active subject to the beginning.\n4. Adjust the verb tense if necessary and remove any passive structures ('is done', 'was seen').\n5. Place the object (what receives the action) after the verb.\n6. Write the final sentence.",

    "instruct_with_technical_details": "Rewrite the following sentence into active voice. Analyze the sentence's current syntactic structure to identify the subject-verb relationship. If the sentence exhibits a passive structure (e.g., Subject + form of 'to be' + past participle [+ 'by' + Agent]), invert or rephrase it to align with the active voice structure (Agent/Subject + Verb + Object/Recipient).",

    "output": "Coral reefs are among the most diverse and beautiful ecosystems and they are in danger of being destroyed by human activities, pollution and climate change. As a result, it is important to protect these valuable environments by implementing conservation measures. To gain a better understanding of the choices and strategies for protecting coral reefs, it is important to understand the ecology and structure of the environments, the threats, and the benefits that conservation provides. \n\nCoral reefs are complex and highly structured ecosystems where species interact and co-evolve. They are made of colonies of small invertebrate animals called corals that form intricate networks and canoes. In addition to being biologically and ecologically important, coral reefs provide important benefits such as food, coastal protection, and protection from extreme weather events. \n\nUnfortunately, human activities have caused significant damage to coral reefs all over the world. The most significant threats are overfishing, coastal development, water pollution and climate change. Global warming has caused coral bleaching which occurs when corals become stressed and expel the algae living inside them which can be fatal. It is also important to note that organic pollutants and sediment discharged into the water can smother and damage coral reefs.\n\nIn order to protect these valuable ecosystems, there are several key strategies that must be implemented. The most important is reducing pollution by controlling agricultural runoff and discharges, controlling coastal development to minimize sedimentation, reducing human activity on the reefs, establishing marine parks and protected areas, and increasing public awareness of the importance of coral reef conservation. Additionally, it is important to monitor changes in water temperature to prevent coral bleaching and to research and employ methods for coral reef restoration. \n\nCoral reef conservation is a pressing issue that requires urgent action from individuals, organizations, and governments. To mitigate the impacts of human activities, it is essential to implement conservation strategies now to protect these beautiful and valuable environments for generations to come.",
