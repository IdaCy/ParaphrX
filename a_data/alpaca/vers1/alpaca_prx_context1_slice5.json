In the US, student debt reached a record $1.5 trillion in 2019, with the average student owing around $32,600. In Canada, the debt situation is not as dire as in the US, but still a cause for concern. The average student debt in Canada is around $26,300, and total student debt reached over $35.4 billion in 2019. Canada does have some advantages compared to the US, such as more generous government loan programs which have allowed students to pay back the loans at lower rates. However, student debt in both countries has been steadily rising in recent years, and is likely to remain a major issue.",

This approach reduces the variance of the predictions made by the decision trees, making the resulting predictions more accurate.

Docker containers are lightweight and highly portable; they can be quickly spun up and transported to different environments such as cloud, bare metal, and on-premises. Containers are isolated from the underlying host system so they can be securely run and managed. Docker also uses images which function like snapshots – making it easy to deploy and run applications reliably and consistently across different environments.",

    "output": "Deploying machine learning models can seem intimidating at first, but once you break down the process, it’s surprisingly simple. Whether you’re deploying a model on your own production environment or pushing it to an existing deployment system, the steps to do so are straightforward. To make the process easier, we’ve outlined the most important steps for deploying a machine learning model.\n\nFirst, you need to package your model. This means creating a container environment. You can use a platform such as Docker to quickly get a container setup. This will allow you to easily create a reproducible build environment that includes all of your model’s dependencies.\n\nNext, you need to create a deployment environment. Typically, this would be a cloud-based platform such as Amazon Web Services. This allows you to easily provision compute and storage resources without having to manage them manually.\n\nThird, you should set up a continuous integration system. This will allow you to easily test the model in production and get immediate feedback on the model’s performance. You can use Jenkins, Travis CI, or any other Continuous Integration (CI) platform.\n\nFourth, you should test and deploy the model. This is where you can use your CI system to test the model in a production environment. If the tests come back successful, you can deploy the model to production.\n\nFinally, you should monitor the model for performance. This is especially important for machine learning models, as their performance can vary greatly from time to time. You can use a monitoring tool such as Splunk or Datadog to track different metrics such as accuracy rate and inference time.\n\nBy following these steps, you can deploy your machine learning model quickly and efficiently. If you need help with any of these steps, you can always reach out to an experienced team of engineers who can make sure your model is deployed correctly.",

Each node in the tree is an intersection in the branches, and these nodes represent a decision point.
