    "instruct_with_examples_and_explanations": "To rewrite a sentence formally, you often replace casual words and structures. For example, transforming \"We gotta fix this soon\" to \"We must address this promptly.\" Here, \"gotta\" becomes \"must\" and \"fix this soon\" becomes \"address this promptly.\" This change replaces a contraction/colloquialism and a casual phrase with more standard and formal alternatives. Please apply this approach and rewrite the given sentence in a more formal tone.",
    "instruct_with_helpful_explanations": "To rewrite a sentence formally, focus on using standard vocabulary instead of slang or colloquialisms. Avoid contractions and simplify complex phrasal verbs. Use more complete sentence structures. With these points in mind, please rewrite the given sentence in a more formal tone.",
    "instruct_with_metaphors": "Shifting to a formal tone is like putting on your professional armor. It prepares your language for the battlefield of academic papers, business negotiations, or official declarations.

    "instruct_with_personal_touch": "Hey there! I know sometimes making things sound formal can feel a bit stiff, but it's a really valuable skill for getting your ideas taken seriously in professional settings. Give it a try! See if you can rewrite the given sentence in a more formal tone.",
    "instruct_with_rebuttals": "Yes, it's true that excessively formal language can sometimes hinder connection, but dismissing formality entirely ignores its crucial role in establishing credibility and clarity in important communications. The goal is appropriate formality, not stiffness. Countering the idea that formality is always bad, rewrite the given sentence in a more formal tone.",
    "instruct_with_similes": "Making a sentence formal is like upgrading from a bicycle to a sedan - it's a smoother, more standard mode of transport for certain journeys. Or it's like switching from sweatpants to a suit - the underlying form is covered by a more appropriate layer for the setting. Using this idea, rewrite the given sentence in a more formal tone.",
    "instruct_with_statistics": "Research shows that documents written with a formal tone are perceived as 60% more credible in professional settings compared to those using informal language. Achieve this increased credibility: rewrite the given sentence in a more formal tone.",
    "instruct_with_step_by_step": "Step 1: Read the given sentence carefully, identifying informal words or phrases.\nStep 2: Consider formal synonyms or alternative phrasing for these informal elements.\nStep 3: Reconstruct the sentence using the formal language, ensuring the original meaning is preserved.\nStep 4: Review the rewritten sentence to confirm it sounds formal and clear. Now, execute these steps: rewrite the given sentence in a more formal tone.",
    "instruct_with_summary": "The task is to transform the style of the input sentence. Specifically, rewrite the given sentence in a more formal tone.",
    "instruct_with_technical_details": "Execute a linguistic register transformation operation on the input sentence. This operation requires analyzing the lexical items, syntactic structures, and pragmatic implications of the sentence to identify informal features. Substitute informal lexical items with their formal counterparts (e.g., phrasal verbs with single verbs, contractions with full forms). Adjust syntactic complexity to align with formal conventions, potentially employing subordination or more complex noun phrases. The output should be the sentence rewritten to achieve a more formal tone.",

    "instruct_role_expert_cot_with_examples_and_explanations_and_summary_and_risks": "Okay, let's approach this systematically as a language expert. **Summary:** Rewrite the sentence preserving exact meaning. \\n\\nThe task is to rewrite the provided sentence while ensuring 100% fidelity to the original meaning. This requires careful analysis of the original sentence's denotation and connotation, identifying key terms and their relationships, and then constructing a new sentence that expresses the same concepts using different linguistic structures or vocabulary. For example, if the original is 'The large dog barked loudly', a valid rewrite is 'The big canine made loud barking sounds.' Here, 'large' is replaced by 'big', 'dog' by 'canine', 'barked' is transformed into the phrase 'made barking sounds', and 'loudly' becomes 'loud'. The key is that the core meaning (a large dog making loud barking sounds) is preserved. **Risk:** The primary risk is subtly altering the meaning. Ensure synonyms chosen are appropriate and sentence structure changes don't introduce ambiguity or shift focus. My thought process will be to first deconstruct the original sentence, then brainstorm alternative wordings, and finally verify that the rewritten sentence is semantically equivalent by comparing the core message. Now, provide the sentence you want me to rewrite, and I'll walk through the process.",
