Here's a general approach:\n\n1. **Recursive Traversal:**  The code likely uses a recursive function to traverse the tree.\n2. **Key Comparison:**  At each node, the code compares the node's value with the values in its left and right subtrees.\n3. **BST Property:**  If the node's value is greater than",

Think of it as a toolbox filled with tools and components designed specifically for building web services. \n\n**Key Components of a Web Service Framework:**\n\n* **Routing:**  This is the core of your framework. It determines how incoming requests are mapped to specific functions or endpoints within your service.\n* **Data Handling:** Frameworks provide mechanisms for handling data, whether it's parsing incoming requests, transforming data into a format your service understands, or sending data back to the client.\n* **Authentication and Authorization:**  Security is paramount. Frameworks often include built-in mechanisms for verifying user identities and controlling access to resources.\n* **Error Handling:**  No service is perfect. Frameworks help you gracefully handle errors, providing informative messages to the client and logging errors for debugging.\n* **Templating:**  For dynamic content, frameworks often offer templating engines to generate HTML, XML, or other formats based on data.\n* **Testing:**  Testing is crucial for ensuring your service works as expected. Frameworks often provide tools and utilities"

Her grandmother's words echoed in her mind: \"The world is a tapestry, Maya, and you are the thread that will weave your own story.\"  \n\nMaya had always felt like a loose thread, lost in the intricate patterns of her family's expectations.  She yearned to find her own path, to discover the colors and textures that made her unique.  So, she had packed her courage and a worn map, and set off into the unknown.\n\nThe forest was a labyrinth of towering trees and whispering leaves.  She followed the map, her heart pounding with a mixture of fear and excitement.  She encountered talking animals, mischievous sprites, and wise old owls who shared their wisdom with her.  Each encounter challenged her preconceived notions, revealing hidden strengths she never knew she possessed.\n\nOne day, she stumbled upon a hidden waterfall, its cascading waters a symphony of sound.  As she sat by its edge, she realized that the journey wasn't just about finding herself, but about letting go of the past and embracing the present.",
