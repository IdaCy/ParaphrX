The sources of air pollution can be broadly categorized into human-made and natural sources. Human-made sources include industrial emissions, transportation, and energy production. Natural sources include wildfires, dust storms, and volcanic eruptions.\n\nTo reduce air pollution, a multi-pronged approach is needed. The following are some of the key strategies:\n\n1. Reduce emissions from human-made sources: This can be achieved through the implementation of stricter regulations on industrial emissions, the use of cleaner energy sources, and the promotion of public transportation and cycling.\n\n2. Encourage the use of cleaner energy sources: This can be achieved through the promotion of renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, and hydro power. Governments can also provide incentives for individuals and businesses to switch to cleaner energy sources.\n\n3. Implement effective waste management practices: This can help reduce the amount of waste that ends up in landfills, which can release methane, a potent greenhouse gas.

The process involves cutting teeth on the gears to create the desired gear ratio.\n\nCogging is a process used in electric motors to increase the torque output of the motor. It is achieved by cutting the teeth on the gears to create a larger gear ratio. This results in a higher torque output, which is useful for applications where high torque is required, such as in heavy-duty machinery or in applications where speed is not critical.\n\nIn the case of electric motors, cogging is achieved by cutting the teeth on the gears to create a larger gear ratio. This results in a higher torque output, which is useful for applications where high torque is required, such as in heavy-duty machinery or in applications where speed is not critical.\n\nIt's worth noting that cogging is not the same as mechanical cogs, which are gears that are designed to be used in mechanical systems. Mechanical cogs are typically used in applications where speed is critical, such as in conveyor belts or in applications where high torque is required. In contrast, electric motors are designed to operate at high speeds and require high torque output, which is why cogging is used to increase the torque output of the motor",
    "instruct_malapropism": "Cogging torque is the torque that is produced when a motor is used to turn a shaft. It is the torque that is produced when the motor is used to turn a shaft in a circular motion. The torque produced by a motor is the force that is required to turn the shaft. When a motor is used to turn a shaft in a circular motion, the motor produces cogging torque. This is because the motor is rotating the shaft in a circular motion, and the torque produced by the motor is the force that is required to turn the shaft. The amount of cogging torque produced by a motor depends on the speed of the motor and the size of the shaft. A motor with a higher speed and a larger shaft will produce more cogging torque.",
    "instruct_musical_notation": "Cogging torque is a phenomenon that occurs in electric motors when the rotational speed of the motor is not constant. This can happen due to various reasons such as mechanical or electrical faults, or due to the motor being overloaded. \n\nIn an electric motor, the rotational speed of the motor is controlled by the magnetic field created by the magnets in the motor. When the magnetic field is not constant, it can cause the rotational speed of the motor to fluctuate. This fluctuation can be due to the presence of cogging torque.\n\nCogging torque is a phenomenon where the rotational speed of the motor is not constant, and it can cause the motor to run at a lower speed than expected. This can be due to the presence of cogging torque. \n\nCogging torque can be caused by a variety of factors, including the presence of a magnetic field that is not constant, or the presence of a mechanical fault in the motor. \n\nTo prevent cogging torque, it is important to ensure that the motor is properly designed and maintained. This can include using a magnetic field that is constant, or ensuring that there are no mechanical faults in the motor. \n\nIn summary, cogging torque is a phenomenon that occurs in electric motors when the rotational speed of the motor is",
    "instruct_paradox_statement": "Cogging torque is a measure of the rotational force required to turn a shaft. It is calculated by multiplying the rotational force by the number of turns of the shaft. The higher the cogging torque, the more difficult it is to turn the shaft. This is because the rotational force is increased, and the shaft must turn faster to overcome the increased force. Therefore, cogging torque is an important factor to consider when designing and operating machinery.",
    "instruct_pun_based": "Cogging torque is a term used to describe the phenomenon of a motor's torque curve being steeper than the torque curve of a typical motor. This means that the motor's torque curve is more like a \"cog\" than a straight line. The steeper torque curve is caused by the motor's internal resistance, which causes the motor to produce more torque at lower speeds and less torque at higher speeds. This can be seen in the diagram below:\n\n![Motor torque curve](https://i.stack.imgur.com/7Z55Z.png)\n\nIn this diagram, the motor's torque curve is steeper than the typical motor's torque curve, which is a straight line. This means that the motor is producing more torque at lower speeds and less torque at higher speeds. This can be useful in certain applications where the motor needs to produce more torque at lower speeds, such as in a motorized wheelchair or a motorized lawn mower.\n\nIn summary, cogging torque is a phenomenon that occurs in motors when the motor's torque curve is steeper than the typical motor's torque curve.

Therefore, the answer is 10.\n\nNote: The problem can be solved using the formula for permutations of n objects, which is n! / (n-r)! where r is the number of objects to be arranged. In this case, n = 21 and r = 1, so the formula becomes 21! / (21-1)! = 21! / 20! = 21 * 20 = 420.\n\nHere is a Python code that solves the problem using the formula for permutations of n objects:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Define the numbers to be arranged\nnumbers = [21, 4]\n\n#"
