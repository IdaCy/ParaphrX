If it is, the function returns 1, as the factorial of 0 is 1.\n2. **Recursive Step:** If `num` is not 0, the function returns the product of `num` and the factorial of `num - 1`. This is the recursive step, where the function calls itself with a smaller input.\n\n**How it works:**\n\nThe factorial of a number is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to that number. For example, the factorial of 5 (denoted as 5!) is 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120.\n\nThe recursive function works by breaking down the calculation into smaller subproblems.

While they shared some similarities, they also differed significantly in their causes, consequences, and overall impact.\n\n**Similarities:**\n\n* **Cold War Context:** Both events occurred during the height of the Cold War, a period of intense geopolitical tension between the United States and the Soviet Union.\n* **Nuclear Threat:** Both crises involved the threat of nuclear war, with the potential for catastrophic consequences.\n* **International Diplomacy:** Both events required complex international diplomacy and negotiations to de-escalate tensions and avoid conflict.\n* **Public Opinion:** Both crises generated significant public concern and debate, with citizens questioning the government's actions and the future of the world.\n\n**Differences:**\n\n**Cause:**\n\n* **Cuban Missile Crisis:** The crisis stemmed from the Soviet Union's placement of nuclear missiles in Cuba, a move perceived as a direct threat to the United States. This was a direct result of the Cold War rivalry and the Soviet Union's desire to counter US influence in the region.\n* **Vietnam War:** The war was a result",

This was a direct challenge to US security and a violation of the Monroe Doctrine.\n* **Consequences:** The crisis brought the world to the brink of nuclear war. The US imposed a naval blockade on Cuba, and the Soviet Union backed down after intense negotiations. The crisis highlighted the dangers of nuclear proliferation and the need for communication and diplomacy.\n* **Impact:** The Cuban Missile Crisis led to a period of heightened tension between the US and the Soviet Union, but ultimately helped to prevent a nuclear war.

It's the torque that's experienced by the rotor when it's not rotating, but is still in contact with the stator. This torque is caused by the magnetic reluctance of the rotor and stator, which creates a torque that opposes the desired rotation.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the concept:\n\n**Causes:**\n\n* **Magnetic reluctance:** The magnetic field lines in the rotor and stator don't align perfectly, creating a reluctance in the path of the magnetic flux.\n* **Non-uniform magnetic field:** The magnetic field strength isn't uniform across the rotor and stator, leading to torque variations.\n* **Stator and rotor geometry:** The shape and size of the stator and rotor can influence the magnetic field distribution and thus, the cogging torque.\n\n**Effects:**\n\n* **Reduced efficiency:** Cogging torque can cause the motor to work harder, leading to increased energy consumption and reduced efficiency.\n* **Increased noise:** The torque fluctuations can cause vibrations and noise in the motor.\n* **Mechanical stress:** The torque can cause stress on the motor's bearings and other components.\n\n**Mitigation:**\n\n* **Improved rotor",

This process is essential for plant growth, development, and survival.\n\n**Overall reaction:**\n\nThe overall reaction for cellular respiration in plants can be summarized as follows:\n\nC6H12O6 (glucose) + 6O2 (oxygen) → 6CO2 (carbon dioxide) + 6H2O (water) + ATP (energy)\n\nThis equation shows that glucose reacts with oxygen to produce carbon dioxide, water, and ATP.\n\n**Major stages:**\n\nCellular respiration is a multi-step process that can be divided into four main stages:\n\n1. **Glycolysis:** This stage occurs in the cytoplasm of the cell and does not require oxygen. It involves the breakdown of glucose into two molecules of pyruvate. During glycolysis, a small amount of ATP is produced, along with NADH, an electron carrier.\n\n2. **Pyruvate oxidation:** This stage occurs in the mitochondria and involves the conversion of pyruvate into acetyl-CoA.

If not, swap them.\n2. **Move to the next pair of balloons.** Compare them and swap if needed.\n3. **Keep repeating this process.** You're always comparing and swapping balloons until you reach the end of the line.\n\nIt's a simple but slow way to sort things, like comparing two balloons at a time. \n\nThink of it like a slow dance, where you're always comparing and swapping until you get the balloons in the right order. \n\n\nLet me know if you'd like to know more about bubble sort!",

This line represents the relationship between the number of lemons and your lemonade sales.\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n1. **Gather your data:** You need to collect some information about how many lemons you used and how much money you made.\n2. **Plot your data:** Draw a graph with the number of lemons on the x-axis and your lemonade sales on the y-axis.\n3. **Find the best-fitting line:** Linear regression uses a special formula to find the line that goes through your data points as closely as possible. This line is called the \"regression line.\"\n4. **Interpret the results:** The equation of the regression line tells you how much your lemonade sales increase for every additional lemon you use.\n\nSo, in our lemonade example, the regression line might look like this:\n\n* **Sales = 2 * Lemons",
