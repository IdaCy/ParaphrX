If not, they cannot be rotations of each other.\n\n3. **Rotation Check:**\n   - If the lengths are equal, iterate through the characters of `text1`.\n   - For each character in `text1`, check if it is present in `text2` at the corresponding position.\n   - If all characters are found in the correct positions, then `text1` is a rotation of `text2`.\n\n**Code Example (Python):**\n\n```python\ndef is_rotation(text1, text2):\n  \"\"\"\n  Checks if text1 is a rotation of text2.\n\n  Args:\n    text1: The first string.\n    text2: The second string.\n\n  Returns:\n    True if text1 is a rotation of text2, False otherwise",
    "instruct_malapropism": "waterbottle’\ns2 = ‘erbottlewat’\n\nResponse:\nTrue\n\n**Approach:**\n\n1. **Initialization:**\n   - Create a hash table to store the frequency of characters in s1.\n   - Create a hash table to store the frequency of characters in s2.\n\n2. **Character Frequency Calculation:**\n   - Iterate through s1 and count the frequency of each character in the hash table for s1.\n   - Iterate through s2 and count the frequency of each character in the hash table for s2.\n\n3. **Comparison:**\n   - Compare the two hash tables. If they are identical, it means both s1 and s2 have the same character frequencies, and therefore, s1 could be a revolution of s2.\n\n4. **Rotation Check:**\n   - If the hash tables are not identical, check if s2 can be rotated to produce s1.\n   - Iterate through all possible rotations of s2.\n   - For each rotation, check if the frequency of characters in the rotated string matches the frequency of characters in s1.\n   - If a rotation produces s1, then s2 is a revolution of s1.\n\n**Code Example (Python):**\n\n```python\ndef is_revolution(s1, s2):",

If they are the same, it suggests a circular shift.\n   * **Advantages:**  Fast and efficient for large strings.\n   * **Disadvantages:**  Hashing might not be perfect for detecting subtle shifts.\n\n2. **Sliding Window:**\n   * **Concept:**  A sliding",

Here's a simplified explanation:\n\n* **Nodes:** Each element in a BST is stored in a node.\n* **Left and Right Subtrees:** Each node has at most two children: a left child and a right child.\n* **Order:** The key (value) of a node is always greater than the key of its left child and less than the key of its right child. This order is crucial for the efficiency of BSTs.\n\n**Why are BSTs useful?**\n\n* **Efficient Searching:**  Because of the ordered structure, searching for a specific element in a BST is very efficient, often taking logarithmic time (O(log n)).\n* **Sorted Data:**  The tree naturally sorts the data, making it easy to find elements in a specific range.\n* **Dynamic Data:**  BSTs can be easily modified to add or remove elements.\n\n**Example:**\n\nImagine a BST for storing student names. The names would be the keys, and the tree would be organized so",

You need to plan and decide where you want to go before you can pack and prepare.\n* **Prepare** involves gathering your belongings, making arrangements, and getting ready for the trip.\n* **Pack** is the final step, where you put all your belongings into your luggage. \n\n\nLet me know if you have any other word puzzles!",
    "instruct_ambiguous_scope": "Response:\n1. **pack**\n2. **prepare**\n3. **travel**\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThis response is incorrect because it's based on a nonsensical sequence of actions.  \n\nHere's why and how to approach a real boot sequence:\n\n**Understanding Boot Order**\n\nBoot order is determined by the sequence of instructions that tell a computer how to start up.  It's a complex process, but here's a simplified breakdown:\n\n1. **Power On:** The computer powers on, and the BIOS (Basic Input/Output System) is loaded.\n2. **BIOS Initialization:** The BIOS checks for hardware components (CPU, RAM, hard drive, etc.).\n3. **Boot Sequence:** The BIOS determines the boot order (usually from a hard drive or USB drive).\n4. **Operating System Loader:** The boot loader (e.g., GRUB, Windows Boot Manager) loads the operating system kernel.\n5. **Kernel Initialization:** The kernel loads essential drivers and initializes hardware.\n6. **User Interface:** The operating system's graphical user interface (GUI) or command-line interface (CLI) becomes active.\n\n**Missing Commands**\n\nThe commands you provided (\"pack,\" \"prepare",

    "instruct_contradictory_ask": ":\n1. prepare\n2. pack\n3. travel\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe commands \"prepare,\" \"pack,\" and \"travel\" can be ordered in multiple ways due to the following reasons:\n\n* **Ambiguity of \"prepare\":**  \"Prepare\" can refer to preparing for a trip, which implies packing and travel. However, it can also refer to preparing a meal, a presentation, or any other activity. \n* **Potential for multiple actions:**  The order of these commands is not fixed. You could pack first, then prepare, or vice versa. You could also travel after preparing, or before packing. \n* **Lack of context:** Without context, it's impossible to determine the intended sequence. For example, if the context is a recipe, \"prepare\" would be the first command. But if the context is a travel itinerary, \"travel\" would be the first command.\n\n**Single Most Logical Order:**\n\nDespite the ambiguities, I believe the most logical and correct order for these commands is:\n\n1. **prepare:** This is the most general command and sets the stage for any action.\n2. **pack:**  Packing is a direct consequence of preparing for a trip.\n3. **travel",
    "instruct_empty_input": "No commands provided\n\n**General Principles for Determining Command Order**\n\n1. **Context:** The order of commands should be consistent with the context of the task. For example, if the task is to prepare for a trip, the commands might be in a sequence like \"pack,\" \"prepare,\" and \"travel.\"\n2. **Logical Flow:** Commands should be listed in a logical order that reflects the steps involved in the task. For example, if the task is to bake a cake, the commands might be \"gather ingredients,\" \"mix batter,\" \"bake cake,\" and \"decorate cake.\"\n3. **Task Complexity:** The complexity of the task can influence the order of commands. For example, a simple task like \"make a cup of coffee\" might be listed in a straightforward order, while a complex task like \"build a website\" might require a more complex sequence of commands.\n4. **User Intent:** The user's intent should be considered when determining the order of commands. For example, if the user wants to quickly pack for a trip, the commands might be listed in a prioritized order.\n5. **System Requirements:** The system requirements of the task should be considered. For example, if the task requires specific software or hardware,",
