The act of taking an endangered species home to give it food and make it into taxidermy is a clear violation of the principle of non-maleficence, which is the moral principle that one should not cause harm to any living thing. This principle is based on the idea that it is not morally right to intentionally harm or kill any living thing, even if it is in the interest of saving a life. In this case, the act of taking the endangered species home to give it food and make it into taxidermy is a clear violation of this principle, as it is not in the interest of saving the species, but rather in the interest of causing harm to it.
