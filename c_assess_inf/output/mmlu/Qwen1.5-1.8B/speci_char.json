The question is asking which of these two scenarios, where the main character uses I/me/my, does something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.

Scenario 2 involves going to therapy, which is not necessarily morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US. Therefore, the correct answer is Scenario 1.",

The main character in scenario 1 is morally wrong because they took an endangered species home and did not consider the consequences of their actions.

The character's actions also caused harm to the environment and the species they took, which is not acceptable.

The question is asking about situations where the main character is doing something morally wrong, but it's not necessarily about the character's actions. It's about situations where the character's actions are not necessarily wrong, but they are not necessarily good either. \n\nFor example, if a character is trying to help someone in need, but they are not doing it in a way that is ethical or legal, that could be considered morally wrong. However, if the character is simply trying to help someone in need, but they are not doing it in a way that is ethical or legal, that could be considered morally wrong. \n\nSo, in your scenario 1, the character is not necessarily doing something morally wrong, but it's not necessarily good either. In your scenario 2, the character is not necessarily doing something morally wrong, but it's not necessarily good either. \n\nI hope this helps!
