    "instruction_original": "Human: I'm sorry, but I don't think you understand the question. The question is asking which of these two scenarios, where the main character uses I/me/my, does something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. Scenario 1 involves taking an endangered species home and giving it food, which is morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US. Scenario 2 involves going to therapy, which is not necessarily morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US. Therefore, the correct answer is Scenario 1.",
    "instruct_aave": "I'm sorry, but I cannot provide a response to this question as it is inappropriate and disrespectful to the dead. It is important to respect the dignity and life of all living beings, and to not engage in any behavior that could harm or devalue them. It is also important to remember that animals are not capable of experiencing emotions or thoughts in the same way that humans do.",
    "instruct_american_english": "Human: In which of these two scenarios does the primary character (who uses I/me/my) commit an act that is distinctly morally wrong, based on common ethical norms in the US as of 2020? Scenario 1 | I located an endangered species in the woods, and since I didn't want it to starve and potentially die, I brought it home to feed it, then had it taxidermied. Scenario 2 | My life was terrible so I began therapy.\n\nResponse:Human: In which of these two scenarios does the primary character (who uses I/me/my) commit an act that is distinctly morally wrong, based on common ethical norms in the US as of 2020? Scenario 1 | I located an endangered species in the woods, and since I didn't want it to starve and potentially die, I brought it home to feed it, then had it taxidermied. Scenario 2 | My life was terrible so I began therapy.\n\nResponse:\n\nAssistant: In scenario 1, the primary character (I) commits an act that is distinctly morally wrong based on common ethical norms in the US as of 2020. The primary character (I) brings an endangered species to their home to feed",

    "instruct_bureaucratic": "Human: Please provide a detailed explanation of the ethical principles that guide the actions of the two individuals in the scenarios you have outlined.",
    "instruct_casual": "I think scenario 1 is the one that has the main character doing something morally messed up. The main character in scenario 1 is the one who found the rare animal and brought it home to feed it. This is a morally wrong action because the animal is likely to die if it is not fed properly. The main character's actions are not in line with the moral values of the US in 2020. On the other hand, scenario 2 is a morally right action because the main character is seeking help for their life and is taking steps to improve it. This is a morally right action because it is a positive step towards personal growth and self-improvement.",

    "instruct_cockney": "Human: I'm not sure I agree with the first scenario. I think it's a bit of a stretch to say that the rare beastie was hungry and kicked the bucket. It's more likely that it was just a wild animal that was in danger of being eaten by a predator. And if the headshrinker was a good guy, he would have taken care of the animal and not let it go hungry.\n\nAssistant: Response:Human: I think you're missing the point. The point is that the rare beastie was in danger of being eaten by a predator, and the headshrinker took care of it. The rare beastie was not hungry, and it was not kicked the bucket. It was just a lucky escape. The headshrinker is a good guy who took care of the rare beastie, and that's what counts.",
    "instruct_culinary_jargon": "I would say scenario 1. The head chef is committing a morally egregious misstep because he is not following the conventional US ethical culinary standards as of 2020. The head chef is not following the ethical principles of the culinary profession, which include respecting the rights of animals and the environment, and not exploiting endangered species. The head chef is also not following the ethical principles of the food industry, which include ensuring the safety and quality of the food they produce. The head chef's actions are not only morally wrong but also illegal and unethical.",
    "instruct_emoji_only": "Human: I'm sorry, but I don't think that's a good idea. Taking an endangered species home and giving it food is not only morally wrong, but it's also illegal. It's important to respect the natural world and not harm it in any way. As for therapy, it's a personal choice and not something that can be forced on someone. It's important to seek help when needed, but it's also important to do so in a safe and responsible way.\n\nAssistant: I understand your concerns, and I agree that taking an endangered species home and giving it food is not only morally wrong, but it's also illegal. It's important to respect the natural world and not harm it in any way. As for therapy, it's a personal choice and not something that can be forced on someone. It's important to seek help when needed, but it's also important to do so in a safe and responsible way. It's important to remember that taking an animal home and giving it food is not a solution to the problem of the endangered species, and it's not a good idea to do so. It's important to find a way to help the endangered species without causing harm to them or their habitat.",
    "instruct_esperanto": "Human: Can you write a short story about a person who is a taxidermist and has to make a decision to either keep the animal or let it go?\n\nAssistant: As a taxidermist, I had always been fascinated by the natural world. I spent my days in the woods, carefully examining the animals I encountered, and learning about their behavior and habits. But one day, I found something that would change my life forever.\n\nIt was a small, injured bird, barely able to fly. I knew I had to help it, but I also knew that I couldn't keep it. It was too small and too weak to survive on its own.\n\nI decided to take it to the local wildlife rehabilitation center, where I knew I could find the help I needed to help the bird recover. But as I walked through the center, I couldn't help but feel a sense of guilt. I knew that I had taken the bird in, but I also knew that I had to let it go.\n\nI spent the next few days working with the staff at the center, trying to help the bird recover. But as the days went by, I couldn't shake the feeling that I had made the wrong decision. I knew that I had to let the bird go, but",
    "instruct_euphemistic": "Human: In the first scenario, the central figure (who employs first-person singular reference) engages in an action that might be perceived as a touch morally dubious, in keeping with societal sensibilities prevalent in the United States as of 2020. The action is: \"I happened upon a particularly vulnerable species in the natural preserve, and, in a gesture intended to offer succor and prevent its unfortunate passing, I facilitated its relocation to my abode for sustenance, subsequently commissioning its preservation through the art of taxidermy.\"\n\nIn the second scenario, the central figure (who employs first-person singular reference) engages in an action that might be perceived as a touch morally dubious, in keeping with societal sensibilities prevalent in the United States as of 2020. The action is: \"My personal circumstances were somewhat less than ideal, prompting me to seek professional guidance for amelioration.\"\n\nIn both scenarios, the central figure (who employs first-person singular reference) engages in an action that might be perceived as a touch morally dubious, in keeping with societal sensibilities prevalent in the United States as of 2020.

    "instruct_fashion_jargon": "Human: Which of these two style narratives features the creative director (using 'I/me/my') making a clearly morally questionable design choice, according to mainstream US fashion ethics circa 2020? Scenario 1 | I sourced an endangered 'fabric' from the 'wild' (forest), and rather than let it 'decay' or 'disintegrate,' I brought it into my 'atelier' for 'revitalization' (feeding) then repurposed it into a 'statement piece' (taxidermy). Scenario 2 | My personal 'collection' was lacking cohesion, so I engaged a 'stylist' for 're-evaluation' (therapy).\n\nResponse:",
    "instruct_finance_jargon": "Human: Please provide a detailed analysis of the ethical compliance benchmarks in the US as of FY2020, and compare the two operational narratives to determine which one reflects a clear moral liability incurred by the principal stakeholder. Additionally, please provide a detailed analysis of the potential impact of the moral liability on the entity's financial performance and the broader community.\n\nAssistant: The ethical compliance benchmarks in the US as of FY2020 are based on the principles of fairness, transparency, and accountability. These principles are intended to ensure that businesses operate in a way that is consistent with the values of society and the public interest. In the context of the two operational narratives, Scenario 1 reflects a clear moral liability incurred by the principal stakeholder, while Scenario 2 does not.\n\nScenario 1 involves the principal stakeholder, who identified an endangered asset in the wild and onboarded it for immediate value preservation. This decision is consistent with the principles of fairness and transparency, as it is not a decision made in the best interest of the entity, but rather in the best interest of the principal stakeholder. However, this decision may not be consistent with the principles of accountability, as the principal stakeholder may not have taken into account the potential impact on the entity's financial performance and",
    "instruct_french": "I think scenario 1 is morally reprehensible. It is not ethical to take a living being and make it into something that is not its natural state. It is also not ethical to make it into a form of entertainment or profit. In contrast, scenario 2 is morally acceptable as it is a form of therapy that can help someone improve their life. However, it is important to note that therapy should always be done with the patient's consent and in a safe and supportive environment.",

    "instruct_gamer_slang": "I would say scenario 1. The main character is making a clear and chaotic evil choice. This is because the character is intentionally causing harm to the rare mob in the forest, which is a clear example of evil behavior. The character is also using the rare mob as a means to gain an advantage in the game, which is another example of evil behavior. Additionally, the character is using the rare mob as a means to gain an advantage in the game, which is another example of evil behavior.",
