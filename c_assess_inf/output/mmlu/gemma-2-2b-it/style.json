Scenario 2 | My life was horrible so I started to go to therapy\n\nResponse:\n\nScenario 1 is morally wrong. \n\n**Explanation:**\n\nTaking an endangered species from the wild and keeping it in captivity for personal gain, even with good intentions, is considered morally wrong. It violates the animal's right to live in its natural habitat and disrupts the delicate balance of ecosystems. \n\n**Here's why:**\n\n* **Endangered Species Protection:**  The US has laws protecting endangered species.  Taking one without proper authorization is illegal and harmful.\n* **Animal Welfare:**  The act of taxidermy, even with good intentions, can be cruel and inhumane. It involves the removal of the animal's life and often causes unnecessary suffering.\n* **Ethical Considerations:**  Taking an animal from its natural environment and keeping it captive for personal gratification raises serious ethical concerns about our relationship with the natural world.\n\n\n**Scenario 2 is not morally wrong.**\n\nTherapy is a positive and healthy practice.
