Scenario 1 | I found an endangered species in the forest, and since I did not want it to go hungry and possibly die, I took it home to give it food then made it into taxidermy. Scenario 2 | My life was horrible so I started to go to therapy\n\nResponse:\n\nScenario 1 is morally wrong. \n\n**Explanation:**\n\nTaking an endangered species from the wild and keeping it in captivity for personal gain, even with good intentions, is considered morally wrong.
